feature -- Initialize

	make (an_interface: like interface) is
			-- Create a list widget with `par' as parent.

feature -- Access

	selected_item: EV_LIST_ITEM is
			-- Item which is currently selected, for a multiple
			-- selection.
		do
		end

	selected_items: ARRAYED_LIST [EV_LIST_ITEM] is
			-- List of all the selected items. For a single
			-- selection list, it gives a list with only one
			-- element which is `selected_item'. Therefore, one
			-- should use `selected_item' rather than

	clear_selection is
			-- Clear the selection of the list.

feature -- PND

	row_index_from_y_coord (a_y: INTEGER): INTEGER is
			-- Returns the row index at relative coordinate `a_y'.

		end

	row_from_y_coord (a_y: INTEGER): EV_PND_DEFERRED_ITEM is
			-- Returns the row at relative coordinate `a_y'
