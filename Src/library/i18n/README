INSTALLATION

You will have to set an environment variable called EIFFEL_I18N that points to the directory that you installed the library into - that is, the directory containing the library's .ecf file.
You will also have to compile the library's C-code.

Linux:

	From the root directory of the library execute the following commands: 
	
	cd Clib/
	finish-freezing -library
	
Under Windows for use without .NET:

	Please make sure you have the environment variable ISE_EIFFEL defined.
	This should have been done during installation of EiffelStudio; if not please refer to it's documentation.  ISE_EIFFEL should point to your EiffelStudio installation.
	Then, depending on which compiler you have, run either \Clib\make_bcb.bat (for the Borland compiler) or \Clib\make_msc.bat (for Microsoft Visual Studio)
	
Under Windows with .NET:

	No extra compilation required.

DOCUMENTATION

Both a user guide and a developer guide can be found in the "doc" directory. As the names indicate, the user guide explains how to use the library and documents it's features, whereas the developer guide is intended for people who want to extend or modify the library. 
HTML and text formats are available.
